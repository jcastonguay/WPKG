To Install:

Unzip wpkg-base.zip to c:\program files\wpkg

If you havn't done this, then make that directory and move these files there.

Double click on cert. select TRUSTED ROOT CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY instead of automatic. Import the Certificate.

Double click on wpkg-start.bat

This will take a while to download and install everything.

Finally, in SteadyState, add wpkg-start.bat to the batch files it runs at 3:00 AM.
